/**
 * SARIF 2.1.0, the format GitHub code scanning ingests.

 * query, and nothing outside GitHub Actions reads them at all. SARIF is the
 * same findings as a durable artifact - uploaded once, tracked across commits,
 * and understood by every dashboard that speaks the standard.
 *
 * The format's failure mode is silence. A SARIF file with a malformed URI, or
 * with results whose `ruleId` names no declared rule, uploads successfully and
 * then annotates nothing: a green check and an empty dashboard. So the two
 * things most likely to be wrong are the two things this module is most
 * careful about - rule descriptors, and URIs.
