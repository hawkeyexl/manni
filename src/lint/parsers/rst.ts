/**
 * reStructuredText -> generic blocks.
 *
 * Unlike its siblings this parser has no AST library under it. There is no
 * usable reStructuredText parser for JavaScript, so this reads the source
 * directly: a line scanner that answers one question - what sections does this
 * document have, and what paragraphs, code blocks, and lists are in each - and
 * then hands `sectionize` the same `Block[]` every other format produces.
 *
 * ## Section levels
 *
 * RST has no fixed heading hierarchy. A title is a line underlined, and
 * optionally also overlined, by a run of punctuation at least as long as the
 * title. Which *level* an adornment style means is discovered, not fixed:
 *
 *   "Rather than imposing a fixed number and order of section title adornment
 *    styles, the order enforced will be the order as encountered."
 *   - the reStructuredText spec, "Sections"
 *
 * So the first style seen is level 1, the next new style level 2, and so on -
 * `===` then `+++` then `---` is a perfectly ordinary document, and a
 * hardcoded character-to-level table would get it wrong. The spec also makes
 * over-and-underlined styles distinct from underline-only ones using the same
 * character, so the style key carries both facts (`over:=` vs `under:=`).
 *
 * Levels are clamped to 6, because `SectionNode.level` is documented 1-6; a
 * document with seven adornment styles is beyond what the templates model.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not handle
 *
 * This is a structural scanner, not docutils. It does not implement, and
 * silently ignores:
 *
 *  - **Substitutions** (`|name|` definitions and references) - a reference is
 *    flattened to its bare name, a definition is skipped with other directives.
 *  - **Includes** (`.. include::`) - the referenced file is never read, so
 *    sections it would contribute are invisible.
 *  - **Transitions** (a lone adornment run between paragraphs) - skipped, like
 *    Markdown thematic breaks.
 *  - **Definition lists**, **option lists**, and **line blocks** (`|`) -
 *    skipped, not mapped onto `list`. A definition list is not a bullet list,
 *    and counting it as one would make `lists: {max: 1}` fail a document a
 *    reader would say satisfies it. This is the same call `mdast.ts` makes for
 *    blockquotes and tables.
 *  - **Doctest blocks** (`>>>`) - recognised so they are not mis-read as prose,
 *    but skipped rather than emitted as `code`.
 *  - **Tables**, grid and simple - recognised and skipped, for the same reason.
 *  - **Block quotes** (a bare indented block) - skipped.
 *  - **Quoted literal blocks** (an unindented literal block quoted with
 *    punctuation) - not recognised; read as prose.
 *  - **Enumerator styles beyond `1.`/`1)`/`#.`/`#)`** - alphabetic and Roman
 *    enumerators (`a.`, `iv.`) and the parenthesised `(1)` form are read as
 *    prose. They are ambiguous without docutils' second-item confirmation:
 *    `A. Smith wrote this` is a sentence, not a list.
 *  - **Roles and inline markup** beyond a regex flattening - `flattenInline`
 *    strips the common constructs; it does not implement inline parsing, does
 *    not process `\` escapes, and leaves trailing reference underscores alone
 *    (stripping them would eat `snake_case`).
 *  - **Tab expansion** in indentation - a tab counts as one column, where
 *    docutils expands to the next multiple of eight.
 *  - **East Asian width** - adornment length is compared against the title's
 *    code-point count, where the spec compares display columns.
 *  - **Document title promotion** - docutils promotes a lone top-level section
 *    to the document title. Here it stays a level-1 section, which is what the
 *    doctype templates model (a title with its subsections hanging under it).
 *  - **Directive options and content semantics** - only `code-block`, `code`,
 *    and `sourcecode` produce a node at all; every other directive is skipped
 *    whole.
 *  - **Anything an unterminated fenced block would need** - a *complete* fenced
 *    front matter block is cut from the body before scanning, because `---`
 *    reads as a transition and the YAML under it as prose. An unterminated one
 *    is not front matter, and is scanned as the RST it literally is.
 *
 * One judgement call is worth stating plainly. The spec requires an adornment
 * run to extend "at least as far as the right edge of the title text", and
 * that is what is enforced here: a shorter run is not a section title, and the
 * line becomes a paragraph. docutils the implementation is more forgiving - it
 * reports "Title underline too short" and recovers - but taking the strict
 * reading is what keeps this parser agreeing with `docmeta`'s RST extractor,
 * which applies the same rule to the document title.

 * field list unrouted, and that field list is how RST authors actually declare
 * `:type: how-to`. The RST-aware reading lives in docmeta's extractor registry,

 *
 * A fenced block wins a key collision: it is the author being deliberate about
 * metadata, where a docinfo `title` is often just the document's own heading
 * read a second time. `present` is the OR of the two - the same shape the HTML
 * parser landed on, so the formats stay consistent.
 *
 * That docinfo `title` is worth knowing about. In RST the page title genuinely
 * *is* the first section title, so a page with a title and no fields comes back
 * with non-null `frontmatter` holding just that. Nothing downstream is misled -
 * routing reads `type` and `$template` - and taking docmeta's answer verbatim
 * keeps one source of truth for what a format's metadata is.
