/**
 * XML -> generic blocks, through a declarative vocabulary mapping.
 *
 * ADR 01001 puts XML last "because structure comes from the document's own
 * element nesting and needs a small per-vocabulary mapping". This is that
 * mapping, and the reason it exists: XML has no headings. Markdown says `##`,
 * AsciiDoc says `==`, HTML says `<h2>` - one universal rule each. XML says
 * whatever its schema says. DITA nests `<topic>`/`<section>` and titles them
 * with `<title>`; DocBook nests `<chapter>`/`<section>`/`<sect1>` and titles
 * them with `<title>` too, but calls a paragraph `<para>` where DITA calls it
 * `<p>`; a house schema calls them something else again. Hardcoding DITA would
 * make "the XML parser" a lie.
 *
 * ## The mapping
 *
 * An `XmlVocabulary` sorts element names into four buckets and says nothing
 * about anything else:
 *
 *  - `sections`   open a section, titled by the first `titles` element among
 *                 their children (or inside a `titleWrappers` child, which is
 *                 how DocBook 5 hides `<title>` in `<info>`).
 *  - `transparent` are structural wrappers with no meaning of their own -
 *                 DITA's `<body>`, `<taskbody>`, `<context>`. The walk passes
 *                 straight through them at the same level.
 *  - `paragraphs` / `code` / `unorderedLists` / `orderedLists` / `listItems`
 *                 are the format-neutral content kinds of `types.ts`.
 *  - everything else is **skipped, with its subtree**, exactly as the Markdown
 *    parser skips a blockquote. A DITA `<note>` is not a paragraph, and its
 *    inner `<p>` must not be counted as one, or `paragraphs: {max: 3}` fails
 *    documents a reader would say satisfy it.
 *
 * That last rule is why `transparent` has to exist as its own bucket: without
 * it, skipping the unmapped `<body>` would skip the whole topic.
 *
 * ## Extending it for a bespoke schema
 *
 * Add one entry to `XML_VOCABULARIES` (or pass your own array to `parseXml`):
 *
 *     { name: "acme", label: "Acme Docs",
 *       namespaces: ["https://acme.example/docs"], roots: ["manual"],
 *       sections: ["manual", "chapter"], titles: ["heading"],
 *       titleWrappers: [], transparent: ["content"],
 *       paragraphs: ["text"], code: ["sample"], codeLangAttributes: ["lang"],
 *       unorderedLists: ["bullets"], orderedLists: ["steps"],
 *       listItems: ["item"] }
 *
 * Nothing else changes: the walk, the levels, the positions, and the fold are
 * vocabulary-independent. This is deliberately not wired to `manni.config.yaml`
 * yet - the shape is the commitment, the config surface is a later decision.
 *
 * ## Which vocabulary a document is in
 *
 * Scored, not guessed: a declared namespace is decisive, then elements only
 * one candidate claims, then the root element name, then the elements they
 * share. That ordering is what settles the ambiguous cases - `<section>`,
 * `<title>` and `<reference>` belong to both built-ins, so a `<section>`-rooted
 * file is decided by whether its prose is in `<p>` or `<para>`. Nothing
 * recognized at all is an error, not an empty tree: see `chooseVocabulary`.
 *
 * ## Levels
 *
 * `sectionize` folds by heading *level*, so nesting is expressed as one: the
 * level is the number of enclosing elements that actually opened a section,
 * plus one. Transparent wrappers do not count, and neither does a section
 * element with no title - an untitled DITA `<section>` is legal, and the honest
 * reading is that it adds no heading and so no level, its content belonging to
 * the section that encloses it. Levels clamp at 6, the range `SectionNode`
 * declares.
 *
 * ## Positions
 *
 * `@xmldom/xmldom` records `lineNumber` (1-based, despite its `index.d.ts`
 * saying "zero based") and `columnNumber` (1-based) on every node, pointing at
 * the `<` of an element's start tag and at the first character of a text node.
 * There is no end position. But *every* node carries a start, including the
 * whitespace text nodes between elements, so the exclusive end of an element is
 * the start of the next node in document order - for indented XML that is the
 * character right after `</tag>`, exactly. Only when a node is last all the way
 * up to the root does that fall back to the end of the document, per the
 * house rule for formats whose parser reports no end.

 * Parse, refusing anything xmldom had to guess at.

 * `warning` through the handler while carrying on with a repaired tree. The
 * line between them is drawn at `error` because in XML the element tree *is*
 * the structure - there is no second signal like a `##` to fall back on - so
 * linting a tree xmldom guessed at reports on a document nobody wrote. A
 * mismatched end tag or a stray `<` puts every following element at the wrong
 * depth, and the findings would be confident nonsense. `warning` is left alone:
 * xmldom recovers from an unquoted attribute value without changing the element
 * tree at all, and attributes here are metadata, not structure.
 *
 * This is also the line docmeta's XML extractor draws, so a file manni lint
 * lints is exactly a file docmeta will read metadata from.

 * Markdown it is the whole story, but in docmeta that function is specifically
 * the *fenced* `---` block reader ("core front matter extraction shared by the
 * markdown, mdx, adoc, rst formats"). An XML file has no fenced block, so
 * `extractFrontmatter(content, "xml")` returns `{ data: {}, present: false }`
 * for every XML document ever written, and `type:` routing for `.xml` would
 * silently never fire. docmeta's *registry* is the right door: its XML
 * extractor reads the root element's attributes (`<task type="how-to">` ->
 * `{ type: "how-to" }`, minus `xmlns*`, with values parsed as YAML scalars)
 * plus the text of simple direct children as dotted keys (`task.title`). That
 * is a real `type`, so an `.xml` page does route.
 *
 * The HTML parser merges a fenced block with its native reading, fenced
 * winning a collision. This one does not, because an `.xml` file cannot carry a
 * fenced block and still be XML: a leading `---` is character data outside the
 * root element, which xmldom reports as an error and `parseDocument` refuses
 * before metadata is ever read. (HTML has no such rule - a comment or stray
 * text before `<html>` parses fine - which is why the merge is right there and
 * would be unreachable code here.)
 *
 * It throws on malformed XML, the same line `parseDocument` draws, but it is
 * called after the parse so in practice it cannot be the one to complain.

 * reasoning does not carry to XML and the rule is deliberately not applied
 * here. An XML document's title is an element - `<title>` - in the body, in
 * document order, exactly where the section fold already looks for it; there is
 * no publishing convention that moves it out. And what docmeta calls this
 * document's "frontmatter" is the *root element's own attributes*, so a `title`
 * attribute would be a second title on the very element that already carries
 * the real one: synthesizing a section from it would nest the document's actual
 * title underneath a duplicate of itself. A document with no title element at
 * all is not a page missing its H1, it is a document with no structure to lint,
