 * outermost rule, because that is how the published templates are written -
 * misaligns against it and reports a cascade. The page is not malformed; the
 * title simply is not written where a naive reading looks for it.
 *
 * So a synthetic heading is prepended, positioned on the metadata that actually
 * carries the title. Everything downstream then sees the document the way a
 * reader sees it rendered.
 *
 * Only when the body has no level-1 heading of its own: prepending one where a
 * real title exists would nest it inside a synthetic parent, which is a
 * different document.

 * "metadata" is the root element's own attributes - do not call this, and
