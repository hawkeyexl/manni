/**
 * Source of truth for templates. Holds the built-in doctype templates
 * (addressed by `vendor:name:version`-style ids) and knows how to load any
 * template reference - a built-in id, a local `.yaml`/`.yml`/`.json` path, or
 * an `http(s)` URL, optionally naming one template inside a file with a `#`
 * fragment (`./templates.yaml#how-to`).
 *
 * Two ordering decisions are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - A file is dereferenced *before* it is validated. `$ref` is how a template
 *    file shares one section rule between templates, and a section rule is
 *    `additionalProperties: false`, so any `$ref` still standing at validation
 *    time would be reported as an unexpected key.
 *  - `instructions` is looked for by hand *before* Ajv runs. The schema rejects
 *    it too (`not: {required: ["instructions"]}`), but a raw schema error says
 *    nothing useful about where the feature went; scanning the parsed data
 *    directly is both more reliable than reverse-engineering which Ajv error
 *    came from the `not` keyword and the only way to quote the author's own
 *    instruction back at them in the migration snippet.
 *
 * `extends` is deliberately *not* resolved by `loadTemplate`. Inheritance needs
 * a resolver that knows what a relative ref is relative to, which only the
 * caller knows, so `resolveExtends` takes that resolver as an argument.
