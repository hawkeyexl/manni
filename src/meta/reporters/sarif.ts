/**
 * SARIF 2.1.0 — the interchange format GitHub code scanning, GitLab, and Azure
 * DevOps ingest directly.
 *
 * What `--format github` cannot do is persist: `::error` workflow commands
 * render on the pull request and then vanish with the job log. SARIF findings
 * become tracked alerts with state across commits, which is what makes "when
 * did this regress" and "is metadata debt trending down" answerable at all.
 *
 * Three properties carry that tracking, and each has a trap:
 *
 * - **`artifactLocation.uri` must be repository-root-relative.** GitHub
 *   resolves it against the repository root and *silently drops* results that
 *   do not resolve — the upload succeeds, with zero alerts. `ValidationResult`
 *   labels are relative to whatever the run resolved against, which is only
 *   coincidentally the repository root, so they are rebased here.
 * - **`ruleId` must not be built from prose.** See `./rule-id.ts`.
 * - **`partialFingerprints` must match the baseline's fingerprint.** One
 *   identity function, two consumers.
