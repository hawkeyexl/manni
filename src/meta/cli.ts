 * outright instead of reporting the paths that are left as missing.
 *
 * The four positive tests mirror `suggestCommand`'s, `existsSync` included —
 * that leg is the one that catches a bare directory name (`manni meta get docs`),
 * which has neither a dot, a separator, nor a glob character.
 *
 * `existsSync` alone is too eager for a token with **no path shape at all**,
 * though, because field names collide with directory names constantly: `tags`,
 * `docs`, `type`, `content`. In a site repo holding a `tags/` directory,
 * `manni meta get tags docs/a.md` was refused as a path, and the remedy it
 * suggested (`manni meta get title tags`) was nonsense. So a shapeless token is
 * only read as a path when it is **alone** — nothing else was offered as one,
 * which is the shape of someone who forgot the field list. Give a path *and* a
 * bare name and the bare name is the field list: the only reading that makes
 * sense of both.
 *
 * Two negative tests matter more than any of the shape tests, because a false
 * positive rejects a legal field list:
 *
 * - a **comma** makes it a list, and a path holding one is vanishingly rare;
 * - a **leading `/`** is a JSON Pointer, the documented way to address a nested
 *   or dotted key — `manni meta get /author/email page.md` is exactly the usage
 *   the separator test would otherwise refuse.
 *
 * They do not run *first*, though, and the distinction is worth stating because
 * the obvious reading of the list above is that they do: a token that names a
 * file which really exists is taken as a path before either is consulted. So a
 * JSON Pointer that happens to match a real absolute path — `/author/email`, on
 * a machine where that file exists — is read as a path. `--fields` is the
 * escape, and is why the guard can afford to be wrong here.
