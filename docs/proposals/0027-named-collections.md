# 0027: named collections: override groups as views

- **Status:** Superseded by [0041](0041-collections.md)
- **Serves:** Devin · D4 · Maya · M2
- **Depends on:** [0021](0021-frontmatter-as-a-database.md). This is its roadmap
  item P2, re-scoped, as Options D explains. Also
  [0024](0024-standard-sql-vocabulary.md), whose "scope the run to one override
  group" remedy gets a name to scope to
- **Relates to:** [0016](0016-flag-ownership.md) (config key ownership),
  [0026](0026-corpus-checks-are-findings.md) (named checks read a lot better over named
  collections)
- **Touches (planned):** `src/core/config.ts`, `src/core/resolve-schema.ts`,
  `src/commands/query.ts`, `reference/{cli,configuration}.mdx`, `ci/query-gates.mdx`,
  `test/*`

## Problem

The flagship corpus rule is that every `author:` names a real page in
`authors/`. It is written today as a self-join against a path glob, 0021's own
worked example:

```sql
SELECT d._path, d.author FROM docs d
LEFT JOIN docs a ON a._path GLOB 'authors/*' AND a.slug = d.author
WHERE d.author IS NOT NULL AND a._path IS NULL
```

The `GLOB 'authors/*'` is noise with two real costs. It duplicates knowledge the
config already holds. The repo that models authors this way almost certainly has
an `overrides:` entry mapping `authors/**` to an author schema. The two
spellings then drift independently. Move the directory, update the config, and
every check quietly matches nothing. And 0024's DDL refusal tells a user to
"scope the run to one override group". That fires when the corpus resolves to
more than one schema set. But override groups have no names to scope by. The
remedy is real and unspellable.

0021's roadmap named this P2. An optional `name:` on config `overrides[]` turns
each override group into a table, or view, of its own, typed from its resolved
schemas. That gives `FROM docs JOIN authors` instead of the `GLOB` self-join.

## Design

```yaml
overrides:
  - name: authors
    files: "authors/**"
    schemas: [./schemas/author.json]
```

```sql
SELECT d._path, d.author FROM docs d
LEFT JOIN authors a ON a.slug = d.author
WHERE d.author IS NOT NULL AND a._path IS NULL
```

### The config key

`name:` becomes an optional override key. Several names are refused at parse
time. A duplicate name is refused, as is the name `docs`. So is a name that is
empty or blank after trimming, since a whitespace-only name would otherwise
become a legal quoted view `" "`. So is a name starting `sqlite_`. SQLite
reserves that prefix for internal objects, and refuses such a `CREATE VIEW`
outright, quoting notwithstanding. Refusing at parse time keeps that failure out
of every later read. Finally, a `name:` on an entry with no `schemas:` is
refused. Such an entry never wins schema resolution, because the resolver skips
schema-less overrides, so its view would be empty by construction. Refusing
follows the config's existing "this entry reads as configured and is not" idiom.
Any other string is legal. View names are quoted identifiers, the same rule 0021
stress 5 set for metadata-key columns.

### Membership, the group a file is validated as

A file belongs to the view of the override that **won its schema resolution**.
First match wins, so views are disjoint. `FROM authors` then means exactly "the
files the author schema judges." This needs one small additive change:
`resolveSchemaSetWithSource` today tells callers *that* an override won
(`source: "override"`) but not which; it grows the matched entry's identity.

Each view is built from the computed member list,

```sql
CREATE VIEW "authors" AS SELECT * FROM docs WHERE _path IN ('authors/ada.md', …)
```

never by translating the config glob into SQL. The config's glob engine is
picomatch, with `**`, braces and negation, and SQLite's `GLOB` is a different
language. Membership is decided once, in the code that already decides it, and
the view records the verdict.

### What the 0024 refusal gains

The split-set DDL refusal can finally say something actionable. Today it ends
"Scope the run to one override group", with no way to name one. With named
overrides it lists the groups it found, as
`the run spans authors (authors/**) and docs (docs/**); re-run over one group's files`.
That turns the remedy from a concept into a copy-pastable next step. That
message change is this proposal's whole delivery on the 0024 gap. Scoping itself
stays what it is today, which is running over that group's paths. A
`--collection <name>` input flag that scopes a run by name is the natural
follow-up. It is recorded here rather than designed here. It is an input-surface
change, and 0005's parity rules say every command would then need to answer for
it.

### Labeling, never a gate

Plain reads resolve no schemas today, which is 0021's founding rule. Resolution
can also *throw* for a single file, when a document `$schema:` URL is one the
trust settings refuse. Building views must not turn a working `SELECT 1` into
exit 2. So the resolution walk runs only when the config has named overrides at
all. A per-file refusal demotes to "member of no view". The file stays a `docs`
row, and every existing query is untouched.

### What a view is not

Writing through a view refuses. That is SQLite's own error, which docmeta
catches and completes with the remedy:
`cannot modify authors because it is a view; write through docs: UPDATE docs … WHERE _path IN (SELECT _path FROM "authors")`.
The write-back machinery is untouched: effect judgment snapshots the `docs`
table, and views live outside it.

## Options

**A. Materialized tables per group.** Rejected: copied rows are a second source of truth,
and a second *writable* surface for the effect gate to police. Views keep one table
authoritative and are read-only by construction.

**B. Views over a SQL translation of the glob.** Rejected: picomatch and SQLite
`GLOB` agree on the easy cases and diverge on `**`, braces and dot-handling.
Those are exactly the cases a docs repo hits. A view over the computed member
list is exact by construction.

**C. Membership by raw glob match (every override whose glob matches).**
Rejected. Overlapping globs would put one file in two collections while only one
schema set judges it. And "the group this file is validated as" is the meaning
that makes `FROM authors` trustworthy in a check. Resolution-winner keeps views
disjoint and consistent with `validate`.

**D. The "typed" half of P2, where view columns are typed from the group's
resolved schemas.** Rejected, and this proposal is the record. Typing requires
resolving and loading schemas inside every read. That imports the trust and
network machinery into a command whose design rule, from 0021, is "no schema
resolution; schemaless and offline". And column affinity would silently change
what existing comparisons match. The name and the join ergonomics are the value
P2 was reaching for; the typing was cost wearing a feature's clothes.

## Stress test

**1. A file's own `$schema:` takes it out of the view. This is stated, not
discovered later.** Resolution precedence puts a document's `$schema` above
overrides, so a file inside `authors/**` that names its own schema, *even the
identical one*, resolves as `document`, not `override`, and exits the view. That
is the design meaning, "the group this file is validated as", and it will still
surprise someone. The implementation emits a stderr notice when a glob-matching
file is excluded this way, naming the file and why.

**2. Trust settings move membership.** With `schemaTrust.documentRefs: none`, the
document's `$schema` is ignored, the override wins the file back, and the view grows.
Membership tracking resolution means membership tracks *everything* resolution honors.
Recorded as a consequence of the design rule, with stress test 1's notice as the
observability.

**3. A trust refusal must not abort a SELECT.** `assertDocumentRefAllowed` throws for a
file whose `$schema` URL the config refuses; `validate` reports that as a per-file
finding, but a query is not a validation. Verified the failure shape in design review:
without the demotion rule, one contributed file would turn every `SELECT 1` over the
corpus into exit 2. Demoted to "member of no view"; the file's row is unaffected.

**4. The IN-list scales past any real corpus.** A view's member list is literal paths.
SQLite's default SQL-length ceiling is ~1 GB; a 10,000-file corpus of long-ish paths is
under a megabyte of view definition. One line records the ceiling; no mitigation needed.

**5. Views ride into `--db`, and that is already covered.** `CREATE VIEW` rows
live in `sqlite_master`, so a `--db` export carries the collections. That is a
feature: open the export in Datasette, and the groups are there. It is also
already inside the export's contract, because 0021 declared the file a
regenerable artifact statements may add objects to.

**6. The effect gate never sees them.** Verified live on `node:sqlite`, Node
24.11.0. Views appear in `sqlite_master` as `type: view`, and `SELECT` through
them works. `UPDATE` through them fails with
`cannot modify <name> because it is a view`. And `PRAGMA table_info(docs)` and
`SELECT * FROM docs`, the two snapshots effect judgment diffs, are
byte-identical before and after `CREATE VIEW`.

## Not breaking

This is additive. It is an optional config key, and some `CREATE VIEW`
statements in a per-run in-memory database. A corpus with no named overrides
builds byte-identical SQL surface to today. Ships as `feat(query):`, a minor
release, demo video per the house rule. A config using `name:` requires a
docmeta at or above this feature everywhere the config is read. That is the
standard new-key caveat, same as 0026's.
