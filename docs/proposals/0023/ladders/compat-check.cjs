// 3. Envelope keys: the companion vocabularies' top-level claims must survive
// alongside every built-in a page could realistically stack them with.
//
// This used to assert that *no* built-in may claim these keys at all, and that
// was the wrong test. It is not the composability law — which is about whether
// two claimants' *values* agree (section 2's method), not about whether a name
// appears twice — and this proposal never argued for the stricter rule. It
// also produced a false positive that stood for a while: `metadata` is claimed
// by anthropic:claude-skill:2.1, whose `metadata` is a free-form object, which
// is *exactly* the arrangement docmeta:artifact-evals is designed around ("an
// artifact's top level is the host tool's contract and `metadata` is its
// sanctioned extension bag"). The overlap there is the design working, not a
// collision.
//
// So the test now asks the real question: does adding the envelope key to a
// document break the other claimant? Errors are compared before and after, and
// only a new error pointing *at that key* counts.
//
// One precondition first. A schema sealed against the family's own floor
// composes with nothing docmeta publishes — docmeta:core requires `title`, so a
// root that forbids unknown keys and does not declare `title` can never be
// stacked with any of the nine. Per-key probes against such a schema report a
// conflict for every key, which says nothing about the key. Those are named and
// set aside with the reason, rather than silently skipped or counted.
