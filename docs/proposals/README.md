# Design proposals

Internal design docs for changes that are bigger than a single PR's commit message. Like `../content-strategy/` and `../maintainers/`, these live inside `docs/` but outside `docs/src/content/docs/**`. So they are **not published** to the site, and are not covered by the dogfood validation or doc-detective run.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Proposed` | Written, stress-tested, not yet accepted. |
| `Accepted` | Agreed; safe to implement as written. |
| `Implemented` | Shipped. The doc stays as the rationale record. |
| `Rejected` | Considered and declined. The doc stays; the reason is the value. |
| `Superseded by NNNN` | Replaced. |

## The set

These came out of a review of the shipped product against the intent recorded in `../content-strategy/`. Each doc names the persona and CUJ it serves, and lists what it depends on. Each also carries a **Stress test** section recording what was tried against the design, and what changed as a result.

0014 was not in the original review. It surfaced while stress-testing 0004, and is the most severe item in the set. **docmeta currently exits `0` when it validates nothing at all**, including when an explicitly named file does not exist.

0015 was reserved by 0008 § stress test 6 and written later. A document's `$schema` outranks config. So in a repo that takes outside pull requests, a contributor can pick the schema their own file is judged against. The file that opts out of the standard is the one that passes. It adds an opt-in constraint; it does not narrow what `$schema` may reference by default.

0017 is the first proposal written under `CLAUDE.md § Supersede a proposal, never amend it`. It supersedes 0012 rather than correcting it. 0012's evidence grep searched for `sent to` while the docs said `sends`, so it concluded no page documented `fill`'s egress when one had for two weeks. The gap it was reaching for is real, and narrower. The docs say *that* content is sent, never *what*, *how much*, or *what is kept*. 0017 answers it mostly by changing the behavior rather than describing it.

0011 shipped much smaller than it was written, and the reason is worth recording because it is the same lesson as 0017's. By the time it was implemented, most of what it asked for had already been done *incidentally* by the proposals downstream of it. 0017 added the M4 CUJ and the egress page while implementing itself, and 0001 renumbered the retrofit page's steps underneath it. What was left was the part no other proposal had a reason to touch. That is the retrofit row's missing M4 tag, the dangling `fill` source-of-truth row, and the two persona sentences. The proposal was not amended to match. It was implemented as written, and the items already satisfied were verified page by page rather than assumed. That check is what turned up the last published-page gap, which no proposal had named. The T1 fix-it page recommends `fill` without ever linking to the M4 egress page.

## Dependency order

At a glance, so a planning pass does not have to reconstruct it from 29 headers.

```
0014 ──┬─> 0006          (0006 can turn a gate into a silent no-op without 0014)
       └─> 0001          (a ratchet makes "0 findings" normal, so 0014 first)

0004 ──┬─> 0001          (baseline paths must resolve config-relative)
       ├─> 0003          (SARIF needs repo-root-relative URIs)
       └─> 0006          (both need the repo root / .git boundary)

0001 ──┬─> 0003          (shared FieldError identity — see below)

0008 ──┬─> 0009          (publishing adds URL refs that must stay durable)
       └─> 0015          (0008 reserved it; --offline is the accidental guard)
0015 ──> 0009            (0009 normalizes document $schema URLs; constrain first)
0011 ──> 0012 ──> 0017   (0012 is the content gap 0011's journey walk exposes;
                          0017 supersedes it — the gap was real, the evidence wasn't)

0021 ──┬─> 0026          (checks run on the query engine)
       ├─> 0027
       ├─> 0028
       └─> 0029
0001 ──> 0026            (check findings ride the baseline)
0024 ──┬─> 0027          (its "scope the run to one override group" remedy gets a name)
       ├─> 0028          (extends 0024's deliberately thin type mapping)
       └─> 0030          (the `--schema <ref>` its design text sketched, shipped as query's -s)

0020 ──┬─> 0031          (parent-is-the-namespace, and both channels validated, applied
       │                  to the next structured format)
0018 ──┤                 (write where you read — load-bearing once a format has two channels)
0014 ──┘                 (why an unreadable corpus errors instead of passing green)

0004, 0014, 0018, 0020, 0026 ──> 0037   (config-relative manifest keys; an orphan entry is
                                         a named input that is not there; owned keys refuse
0037 ──> 0038            (a remote manifest under 0008's offline, timeout and retry rules;
                          fetched every run, never cached)
0037 ──> 0039            (entries keyed by a frontmatter field; 0015's risk bounded by a
                          duplicate finding on every page that shares the value)
                                         writes rather than land in the document; both
                                         channels validated, no tiebreak; the orphan check
                                         runs only on the config corpus)
```

The four `Proposed` SQL items (0026–0029) are independent of each other, with one exception. 0026 and 0029 both grow `query`'s `-f` value list. Each specifies the combined six-value surface, and whichever is implemented second merges into the one const. Recommended implementation order is 0026 → 0029 → 0027 → 0028, which is impact-first. The two config-touching ones (0026, 0027) land apart, so the second rebases trivially.

**Safe to start in any order, no blockers:** 0031. Its dependencies are all shipped, and the arrows above record which rules it inherits, not what it waits on. 0011 held this slot until it shipped. 0023, the only other `Proposed` entry, is not in this bucket. It waits on public review rather than on an implementation slot.

**Shipped so far:** everything the table above marks `Implemented`. Through 0025 that is all but 0023 (`Proposed`), 0016 and 0019 (`Accepted`, nothing to ship), and the superseded or rejected halves the Status column records. It also includes the standalone false-green guard called out in [0008 § Problem](0008-remote-schema-durability.md#problem). The dependency graph above is kept as the record of why the early set landed in the order it did.

**Next, if you want the thread continued:** the 0026 → 0029 → 0027 → 0028 order above.
(This line pointed at 0009 until 0009 shipped; the Status column, not this paragraph,
is the ground truth for what remains.)

## Shared prerequisite

0001 and 0003 both need a violation to have a **stable machine identity**, and `FieldError` does not carry one today. `toFieldError` in `src/core/validator.ts` keeps Ajv's prose `message` and discards `keyword`, `schemaPath`, and `params`. Both proposals therefore depend on the `FieldError` extension described in [0001 § Prerequisite](0001-validation-baseline.md#prerequisite-fielderror-needs-a-machine-identity). Implement it once, in whichever lands first.

## Reproducing the evidence

Every "Problem" section cites commands that were actually run against the built
CLI at `3.4.0`. To re-run them:

```bash
npm ci && npm run build
```

Then follow the transcript in the proposal. Sandboxes are disposable temp dirs;
nothing in this repo is mutated.
