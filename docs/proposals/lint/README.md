# Architecture decisions

Why `moose-lint` is built the way it is. Each record states the problem, the
options that were actually considered, and what was chosen. Then it states what
the choice costs, which is the part worth reading.

These are a log, not a specification. A record describes the decision as it was
made; where later work changed something, the later record says so. If the code
and a record disagree, the code is what runs and the record needs fixing.

## Writing one

Follow the format of the existing records. They open with frontmatter
(`status`, `date`, `decision-makers`). Then come Context and Problem Statement,
Decision Drivers, Considered Options, Decision Outcome, Consequences,
Confirmation, and Pros and Cons of the Options.

Two things make a record worth having. **Name the options you rejected**, and
say what was good about them; a record listing only the winner is an
advertisement. And **write the Confirmation section**, naming the tests that
would fail if the decision were reversed. A decision nothing checks is a
preference.
