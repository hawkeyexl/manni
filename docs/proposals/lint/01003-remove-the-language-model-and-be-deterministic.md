# Remove the bundled language model; structure linting is deterministic

## Context and Problem Statement

The `instructions:` key let a template attach natural-language requirements to a
section, such as "Must mention the intent of the document".
`instructionValidator` evaluated them by running **Llama 3.2 3B locally**,
through `node-llama-cpp`. A JSON-schema grammar forced a pass/fail verdict.

The cost was not subtle. A `postinstall` script downloaded roughly 2 GB of model
weights into a temp directory on every install. A `DOC_STRUCTURE_LINT_PRELOAD`
environment variable gated it, and CI had to set that variable. A model
context and chat session were created, and the model reloaded from disk, **once
per section per run**. And the answer was a sample from a 3B model. The same
document and the same template could pass and then fail, so the tool could not
be a gate.

It was also the wrong tool in the wrong repository. This is one of a family.
`moose-meta` validates frontmatter against JSON Schema and `moose-kg` derives
graphs. `moose-docevals` judges prose with an LLM behind a provider abstraction
and a consensus/confidence layer. `moose-tracevals` does the same for agent
traces. `moose-docevals` already treats this tool as a deterministic *grader* it
invokes (`tool:doc-structure-lint`). Two tools in one family both making AI
judgments is a duplicated capability. This one was strictly worse: a bundled 3B
model with no confidence gating.

## Decision Drivers

- A linter that is used as a CI gate must be a total function of its inputs.
- Judgment about prose already has an owner in the family, with the provider
  abstraction, cost ceilings, and ensemble judging this tool does not have.
- A 2 GB `postinstall` download is a serious cost for a structure checker, and it
  is paid by everyone, including users with no `instructions:` in any template.
- Templates in the wild carry `instructions:`, and those authors must be told
  where the capability went, not left to discover silence.

## Considered Options

- **Remove it; make `instructions:` a hard template error naming the replacement**
- Remove it silently, ignoring the key
- Keep it, behind an opt-in flag, on `@hawkeyexl/inference` instead of a bundle
- Keep it as is

## Decision Outcome

The chosen option is to **remove it, and reject `instructions:` loudly.**

Deleted: `src/rules/instructionValidator.js`, `src/util/preloadModel.js`,
`src/util/tempDir.js`, the `node-llama-cpp` dependency, the `postinstall` and
`clean` scripts, and `DOC_STRUCTURE_LINT_PRELOAD` from the package and from CI.

`instructions:` is rejected rather than ignored, by both the schema and the
loader. `validateTemplateFile` finds it first and throws, so the message names
the offending template path and prints the equivalent `moose-docevals` eval.
The author's own instruction text is carried across:

```
templates.yaml: "templates.how-to.sections.title" uses `instructions`, which
moose-lint no longer evaluates — structure checking is deterministic. Move it to
a moose-docevals assertion eval in moose.config.yaml:

  docevals:
    evals:
      how-to-title:
        assertion: Must mention the intent of the document
        grader: ai
```

Removing the model also made the whole validator **synchronous**. `validateSection`
was `async` only to await the model. With it gone, matching and every rule are
ordinary function calls, and the recursion through subsections loses its
`await`-in-a-loop.

Three other dependencies went with it, all replaced by the platform or by the
family:

- `axios`, because Node 24 has `fetch`, which `docmeta`'s registry already uses.
- `crypto`, an npm shim of a Node builtin.
- `uuid`, because the parser now identifies sections by slug, as `moose-kg` does.

Together with `node-llama-cpp`, that is the entire native-code and network
surface of the install.

### Consequences

- Good, because the same document and template now always produce the same
  findings, which is what a CI gate requires.
- Good, because install is a plain JavaScript dependency tree: no native build,
  no model download, no `postinstall`.
- Good, because the family's boundary is now stated rather than implied.
  moose-lint answers "does this page have the shape it claims", and
  moose-docevals answers "is the prose any good".
- Good, because a run costs milliseconds instead of a model load per section.
- Bad, because a real capability is gone from this tool, and templates using it
  break at load time rather than degrading. That is deliberate: silence would
  mean a rule the author believes is enforced, is not.
- Bad, because the migration is manual. The error prints the eval to paste, but
  nothing writes it to `moose.config.yaml`. An `eject-instructions` command was
  considered and deferred; it can be added if real templates make it worth it.
- Neutral, because `moose-docevals`' `tool:doc-structure-lint` adapter is
  unaffected by this change specifically. It parses the JSON reporter, whose
  shape is unchanged. It does need updating for the rename, separately.

### Confirmation

`grep -Eri "llama|preloadModel|tempDir|DOC_STRUCTURE_LINT_PRELOAD"` over `src/`,
`package.json`, and the workflow returns nothing.

The `instructions:` rejection is pinned in `test/unit/template-registry.test.ts`.
It was also exercised end to end against this repository's own `templates.yaml`,
which carried two `instructions:` blocks. The CLI exited 2 with the migration
message before the blocks were removed, and exits 0 after.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Remove it; make `instructions:` a hard template error naming the replacement

- Good, because no author silently loses a check they wrote.
- Good, because the error is actionable: it contains the replacement config.
- Bad, because it is a breaking change for any template using the key.

### Remove it silently, ignoring the key

- Good, because no template stops loading.
- Bad, because a rule the author believes is enforced quietly is not. That is
  the worst outcome available for a tool whose job is enforcement.

### Keep it behind an opt-in flag, on `@hawkeyexl/inference`

- Good, because it preserves the capability without the bundled model, and
  reuses the family's provider layer.
- Bad, because the tool is then only conditionally deterministic, and "was the
  flag on?" becomes part of reading any result.
- Bad, because it rebuilds a worse `moose-docevals` inside a linter: no
  ensemble, no confidence gating, no cost ceiling.

### Keep it as is

- Good, because it costs nothing to decide.
- Bad, because every objection above stands, and each release makes the 2 GB
  install and the nondeterminism harder to walk back.
