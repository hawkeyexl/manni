# Personas

Four concrete personas, one per audience. Each writing task should be anchored to the persona(s) it serves. See `cujs.md` for the end-to-end journeys each persona must complete.

## Maya, Documentation Engineer (LEAD persona)

Maya owns a 2,000-page docs-as-code repo for a platform product. She is comfortable with Markdown, YAML, Git, and reading a CI config. She is not a JSON Schema expert.

**Goal:** every doc has correct, complete frontmatter so the search index and the content catalog stay trustworthy.

**Pains:**
- Contributors omit required fields like `type`.
- Values are fat-fingered, with `date-time` formatted incorrectly or enum values misspelled.
- Metadata drifts as the team grows, and she has no enforcement mechanism. All she has is review fatigue.

**How she uses manni meta.** She installs it, writes or adopts a schema, adds a CI step, then mostly operates it hands-off. She returns when the standard needs tightening.

**The one decision she is not equipped for.** `fill` is the only part of manni meta that sends her documents to a third party. Clearing the retrofit backlog (M4) therefore makes her choose a provider, or refuse hosted inference entirely and run it on her own hardware. She does not own her organization's data-egress policy, but she is the one who has to answer to it. And the default is detected from her environment rather than chosen.

**Why she is the lead persona.** She is the primary adopter. She touches installation, config, schema selection, and CI wiring, which is every layer of the stack. Her journey (M1) is the anchor.

## Devin, Platform / CI Engineer

Devin maintains CI/CD infrastructure for dozens of repos on a mix of GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and pre-commit. He scripts everything and has high technical proficiency.

**Goal:** drop in a metadata gate that is identical everywhere, cheap to run, and feeds results into existing tooling without custom glue per repo.

**Pains:**
- Per-tool config sprawl: different CI recipe for every linter/checker.
- Needs stable, documented exit codes and machine-readable output (JSON, annotation format) so results flow into dashboards and PR bots without fragile parsing.
- Wants one canonical schema shared across repos rather than copies that drift.

**How he uses manni meta.** He installs via a CI step, sets flags, and plugs the exit code into a pipeline gate. He can also pass JSON output to a dashboard. He returns when a new CI platform is added or the output format changes.

**The one command that breaks his model of the tool.** Every other part of manni meta reads files and stays on the box, so `fill` is the exception he has to make a call on. It is the one thing that transmits repo content off-site. Provider detection also means an unpinned runner picks one from whatever environment variable happens to be set. Failing that, it falls through to a multi-gigabyte local-model download on every fresh agent. He pins it in config rather than leaving it to the environment.

## Sara, Schema Author / Information Architect

Sara defines what the metadata *means*. That covers which fields are required and which are recommended, what value formats are acceptable, and the versioning policy for the standard. She has medium-to-high proficiency and understands data modeling, and she is actively learning JSON Schema's finer points.

**Goal:** encode the metadata standard as a JSON Schema, wire it to the right documents, and evolve it safely as requirements change.

**Pains:**
- Dialect confusion. The differences between draft-07 and 2020-12 trip her up.
- Precedence uncertainty. She isn't sure whether `$schema` in a file overrides the config, or the other way around.
- Shipping a stricter required field without breaking every existing repo overnight.

**How she uses manni meta.** She authors schemas, starting from the OKF built-in or from scratch. She wires them to directories via config overrides, tests resolution, and manages upgrades with versioned URLs.

## Theo, Doc Contributor (high-volume, secondary)

Theo is a developer or technical writer who opened a PR. The manni meta check is red. He has low context on the tool and is not interested in learning it. He wants to fix the one thing blocking his PR.

**Goal:** understand the specific error, find the offending field and line in his file, fix it, confirm locally, and move on.

**Pains:**
- Error messages are terse with no obvious remediation hint.
- He doesn't know which schema fired or why that rule exists.
- He doesn't want to read the full documentation. He wants a targeted answer.

**How he uses manni meta.** He follows the error link, or searches, to reach the fix-it page. He maps the error to a field and file location, then applies the fix. He runs `npx manni meta validate <file>` locally to confirm green, and he is done.
