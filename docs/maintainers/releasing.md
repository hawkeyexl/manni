# Releasing

Releases are automated by
[semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) via
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml). On a
push to a release branch it reads the conventional commits since the last tag
and computes the next version. It then updates `CHANGELOG.md`/`package.json`,
tags, creates a GitHub Release, and publishes to npm.

| Branch    | npm dist-tag            |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `main`    | `latest`                |
| `next`    | `next` (prerelease)     |
| `feat/**` | per-branch prerelease   |

You don't run anything by hand for a normal release. Merge a PR with the right
commit types, and the workflow does the rest. The two pieces below are
**one-time infrastructure setup** that's already configured. This page documents
it so it can be recreated or audited.

## npm publishing: OIDC trusted publishing

The workflow publishes to npm with **no `NPM_TOKEN`**. It uses
[trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers): npm exchanges
the workflow's OIDC token (the `id-token: write` permission) for a short-lived,
scoped publish credential, and mints provenance automatically.

Configured on npmjs.com under the package's **Settings → Trusted Publisher**:

- Provider: **GitHub Actions**
- Repository: `hawkeyexl/manni`
- Workflow filename: **`release.yml`** (exact, case-sensitive)

The workflow bakes in four requirements. It needs a GitHub-hosted runner, npm
CLI ≥ 11.5.1 (Node 24 bundles a new enough npm), and `@semantic-release/npm`
≥ 13. It also needs `repository.url` in `package.json` to match the repo.
Do **not** add `registry-url` to `setup-node`, or any
`NPM_TOKEN`/`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`. A written-out auth token in `.npmrc` shadows OIDC
and breaks the publish.

## The moving major tag

`uses: hawkeyexl/manni@v0` works because the release job force-updates a `v4`
tag on each stable release. semantic-release creates immutable `vX.Y.Z` tags and
nothing else, so without that step the reference resolves to nothing.

The step is gated three ways, and each gate closes a distinct way of aiming the
tag at something unreleased:

| Gate | Without it |
|---|---|
| `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` | a `next` or `feat/**` prerelease claims the major tag |
| the version changed during the run | a push of only `chore:`/`docs:` commits releases nothing, and the tag moves to an unpublished tree |
| the version has no `-` suffix | belt and braces on the first, since prerelease identifiers come from the branch name |

It tags `v$version` rather than `HEAD`, because semantic-release commits the
changelog and version bump itself, so `HEAD` is not necessarily what it tagged.

It force-pushes with the GitHub App token explicitly, because the `checkout`
step sets `persist-credentials: false`. The job holds `contents: write`, but no
credential sits in git's config. The App is also the only actor allowed to
bypass the `main` ruleset.

Consumers wanting an immutable reference pin `@v4.1.0` instead; that is the usual
trade and needs nothing here.

## Pushing the release commit past branch protection

`main` has a ruleset requiring all changes to go through a pull request. The
default `GITHUB_TOKEN` can't bypass it, so `@semantic-release/git`'s direct push
of the release commit is rejected with `GH013`. To fix this, the release runs as
a **GitHub App** that is the sole bypass actor on the ruleset.

### One-time setup

1. **Create a GitHub App** (Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New).
   - Name it something like `manni-release-bot`.
   - Set the homepage URL to the repo URL (any valid URL works).
   - Uncheck **Webhook → Active**.
   - **Repository permissions:**
     - Contents: **Read and write** (release commit, tag, GitHub Release)
     - Issues: **Read and write** (comment on released issues)
     - Pull requests: **Read and write** (comment on released PRs)
   - Where can this App be installed: **Only on this account**.

2. **Generate a private key** for the App (App settings → Private keys →
   Generate) and note the **App ID** (shown at the top of the App settings).

3. **Install the App** on the `hawkeyexl/manni` repository
   (App settings → Install App → choose the repo).

4. **Add repository secrets** (repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - `RELEASE_APP_ID` holds the App ID from step 2.
   - `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` holds the full contents of the `.pem` private
     key.

5. **Add the App as a bypass actor** on the `main` ruleset (repo Settings →
   Rules → Rulesets → `main` → **Bypass list** → Add bypass → select the App).
   Set its bypass mode to **Always**, because the release pushes directly rather
   than through a PR.

   Equivalent via the API (replace `<APP_ID>`):

   ```bash
   # Find the current ruleset ID for `main` (don't hardcode it — it changes if
   # the ruleset is deleted and recreated):
   RULESET_ID=$(gh api repos/hawkeyexl/manni/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.name=="main") | .id')

   gh api repos/hawkeyexl/manni/rulesets/$RULESET_ID > /tmp/rs.json
   jq '.bypass_actors += [{"actor_id": <APP_ID>, "actor_type": "Integration", "bypass_mode": "always"}]' \
     /tmp/rs.json > /tmp/rs.new.json
   gh api repos/hawkeyexl/manni/rulesets/$RULESET_ID --method PUT --input /tmp/rs.new.json
   ```

   For an `"Integration"` bypass actor, `actor_id` is the **App ID** (the same
   value as `RELEASE_APP_ID`).

The workflow mints a short-lived token from this App
(`actions/create-github-app-token`). It hands that token to semantic-release as
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the release commit is pushed by the App and bypasses the
ruleset. (The token controls which actor authenticates the push, not the git
`author`/`committer` fields, which semantic-release sets independently.) The
release job skips its own release commit with a job-level `if:` that matches the
`chore(release):` subject prefix, so it doesn't re-trigger. It deliberately does
not use `[skip ci]`. GitHub honours that marker anywhere in a pushed message,
and a squash merge concatenates a branch's commits. Prerelease markers therefore
rode into `main` and skipped Release and Docs both.
