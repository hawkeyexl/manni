/**
 * The validate+checks path resolves every file's schema set exactly once.
 *
 * `validate`'s per-file loop already resolves each file; when the named
 * corpus checks then build collection views (proposal 0027), the membership
 * walk must reuse those resolutions instead of re-resolving the whole corpus
 * a second time. The counter seam wraps `resolveSchemaSetWithSource` — the
 * one function both walks go through — and the parity cases pin that reuse
 * changed nothing observable: the "$schema won" notice still fires, and a
 * file whose resolution failed is still a member of no view.
