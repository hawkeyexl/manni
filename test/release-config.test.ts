/**
 * The release commit must be recognisable to the workflow that must not
 * re-release it.
 *
 * These two files agree by convention and nothing else. `.releaserc.json`
 * decides what semantic-release's release commit is called;
 * `.github/workflows/release.yml` decides which commits the release job
 * declines to run on. Change the template and the guard stops matching, with
 * no error anywhere — the job simply starts running on its own release
 * commits.
 *
 * The reverse pairing is the one that actually cost something. The guard used
 * to be `[skip ci]` inside that same message, which GitHub honours anywhere in
 * a pushed commit's message. A squash merge concatenates the branch's commit
 * messages, and a `feat/**` branch accumulates `chore(release): ... [skip ci]`
 * prerelease commits by design — so every squashed feature merge carried the
 * marker into `main` and skipped Release and Docs entirely. Seven of the eight
 * merges before the fix released nothing at merge time.
