/**
 * The published pre-commit hook's `files` pattern must cover exactly the
 * extensions docmeta actually reads.
 *
 * Both directions matter, and each has its own failure. Too narrow and the hook
 * silently skips files the CLI would have checked — a green commit over an
 * unvalidated page, which is the failure docmeta exists to prevent. Too wide and
 * pre-commit hands docmeta files it will refuse, turning an unrelated commit
 * red.
 *
 * `test/extractors.test.ts` asserts only that `supportedExtensions()` *contains*
 * a handful of extensions. That is why the pattern first drafted for this hook
 * could omit `.markdown` and `.asciidoc` without anything noticing: a
 * containment check cannot see an omission. This one is an exact-set check on
 * purpose.
