/**
 * Source check for GFM table rows split across lines.
 *
 * A table row has to occupy one source line. A following line that does not
 * start with `|` ends the table and begins a paragraph, so the cell it was
 * meant to continue renders cut off mid-sentence. In #154 a prose reflow broke
 * fifteen rows this way across nine files, and the Action reference shipped a
 * cell reading "manni's exit code. `0` clean, `1` validation failures, `2`"
 * and stopping there.
 *
 * Nothing caught it. `docs:check-links` passed with 4,348 links resolving and
 * the Astro build emitted all 50 pages, because the output is valid HTML whose
 * links all work. It is only wrong. That is the gap this closes: unlike the
 * drift checks next to it, which compare a page against a source of truth,
 * this one reads the Markdown source, because the defect is invisible by the
 * time the site is built.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow. A line starting with `|` and not ending
 * with one is only a finding when the previous non-blank line is itself a full
 * `|...|` row, a delimiter row included. Without that table-context test, a
 * wrapped prose paragraph whose second line happens to begin with `|` reads as
 * a broken row; `docs/proposals/0005-command-parity.md` had exactly that case,
 * from an inline code span containing a pipe.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-table-rows.mjs [path...]
 * With no arguments it scans the tracked `*.md` and `*.mdx` corpus, minus
 * `test/fixtures/**` (deliberately malformed test data) and `CHANGELOG.md`
 * (semantic-release writes it). Explicit paths are scanned as given, so a test
 * can point it at a fixture.
 * Exit 0 = every row is on one line, 1 = split rows found, 2 = setup error.
