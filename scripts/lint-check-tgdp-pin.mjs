/**
 * Is the TGDP pin still current?
 *
 * The built-in doctype templates are derived by hand from The Good Docs
 * Project's published templates at a specific release, and their ids carry that
 * release (`tgdp:how-to:1.6`). A version in an id is a promise about which
 * upstream revision the template mirrors, and a promise nobody checks decays
 * quietly — so this asks the registry what the latest release is and compares.
 *
 * It is a report, not a gate: upstream moving does not make the pinned
 * templates wrong, it makes them old. Run it in a scheduled job or by hand.
 *
 *   npm run lint:check-tgdp-pin              report; exit 0 even when behind
 *   npm run lint:check-tgdp-pin -- --strict  exit 1 when behind, for a nagging CI job
 *
 * Exit status is set via `process.exitCode`, never `process.exit()`: calling the
 * latter while `fetch`'s handles are still unwinding aborts the process on
 * Windows with a libuv assertion and reports 127, which reads as a failure of
 * the check rather than of the exit.
