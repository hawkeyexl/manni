/**
 * Liveness check for the published built-in schemas.
 *
 * `check-builtin-schemas.mjs` is the *local* half of this promise: it asserts
 * that `src/meta/schemas/**`, `docs/public/schemas/**`, and the hashes in
 * `src/meta/schemas/manifest.json` all agree. Every one of its checks passes on a
 * repository whose docs site is 404ing, because none of them leaves the disk.
 *
 * That gap matters more here than it would elsewhere. docmeta tells people a
 * version-pinned schema URL never changes, and invites them to depend on it from
 * `$schema` in a document or from `schemas:` in a config. The people taking that
 * offer are not necessarily running docmeta at all, so if a Pages deploy drops a
 * file, changes the base path, or serves something stale, nothing in this repo
 * notices and nobody upstream can tell us — their build just starts failing on a
 * URL we published.
 *
 * So this fetches each URL for real and hashes what comes back. It is the one
 * check that cannot run on a PR (no network guarantees, and a contributor should
 * not see red for someone else's outage), which is why it runs on a schedule
 * instead. See `.github/workflows/published-schemas.yml`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-published-schemas.mjs [baseUrl]
 * Exit 0 = every URL serves the bytes the manifest records, 1 = drift or an
 * unreachable URL, 2 = setup error.
