/**
 * Smoke-test the built package, not the source.
 *
 * The unit and integration suites run against `src/`, where the module that
 * reads the built-in templates sits under `src/lint/core/`. `tsup` bundles the
 * library into one chunk at the root of `dist/`, three directories up from
 * there. A path that is correct in the repo can be wrong in the published
 * package, and every test still passes. That is exactly how it happened once,
 * which is why the templates are now resolved from the package root.
 *
 * This runs the real `dist/cli.js` the way a user would, and asserts the parts
 * that only exist after a build: that built-ins load, that a page routes by its
 * `type`, and that exit codes are what CI will branch on.
 *
 * Usage: npm run lint:smoke   (runs `build` first)
